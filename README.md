# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **customer churn** using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to the situation where customers stop using a company’s product or service.

By analyzing historical customer data, this project builds predictive models that identify customers at risk of churning, enabling businesses to take proactive retention measures.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Customer retention is critical for business growth, and acquiring new customers is often more expensive than retaining existing ones.  
The challenge is to accurately predict which customers are likely to churn based on their behavior and usage patterns.

This project addresses the problem using supervised machine learning algorithms to classify customers as **churned** or **not churned**.
